# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Checks

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  typescript:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
